1. What's the probability that a student who drops out will re-enroll?

1. What's the probability that a senior will graduate?

1. Does that probability depend on how many years it took them to achieve senior class standing?

Write down the $6 \times 6$ transition matrix for the university graduation rate Markov chain model.

1. Should the probabilities within each .bold[row] sum to 1?

Read over state/chain classifications and apply these labels to the following Markov chains:

.pull-left[

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = "85%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/mc1.png")

knitr::include_graphics("figs/mc2.png")

```
]

.pull-right[
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = "85%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/mc3.png")
knitr::include_graphics("figs/mc4.png")
```
]
